# **🛡️System Threat Forecaster**
***System Threat Forecaster*** is a machine learning-based project designed to predict and classify potential threats to computing systems. By analyzing historical threat data and system behavior patterns, the model aims to proactively forecast security risks, enabling preemptive action and enhanced cyber defense.

## **🔍 Features**
- Multi-class classification of system threats (e.g., malware, phishing, DoS attacks)

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering pipeline

- Training with supervised machine learning models

- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

- Scalable architecture for integration with real-time monitoring tools

## **🧠 Technologies Used**
- Python (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)

- Jupyter Notebook for model development

- CSV/JSON for dataset handling

## **📈 Results**
Achieved high accuracy in classifying threats across multiple categories, showing promising results in detecting anomalies and potential security risks.

## **🚀 Future Scope**
- Integration with real-time log data

- Deployment using Flask or FastAPI

- Enhanced threat classification using deep learning models
